# TheCodingBot
Welcome to TheCodingBot, the hobby Discord bot created by TheCodingGuy#6697. Packed with moderation, fun, and craziness, it's the only bot you'll ever need! ~~Until Discord updates their API and breaks the bot. :^)~~

## Version 6
Version 6 is the next generation of TheCodingBot. Currently written in Discord.JS v14, it contains all the latest groundbreaking new features of Discord - like slash commands!

**WARNING:** TCBv6 is not considered officially stable. Check back soon, though. :eyes:

And, I have no idea when Version 6 will release as my schedule is as haywire as this code.
 ...well, maybe worse than the code, but- anyways!

## Proper instructions coming soon!

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
I'm not gonna hold your hand the entire way through. If you are genuinely confused on something I wrote, I'll assist.
And no, I'm not gonna merge anything and everything into the branch. I'll most likely make small changes to fit the code (if needed) and then merge it.
 - :warning: **If the code is fully unable to merge, the idea is stolen, doesn't make sense, etc. I will *not* accept your request.**
And before you say anything, no I'm not strict, I'm just trying to set some order around here. kthx.
